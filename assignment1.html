    <h1>Colors</h1>
    <h2>Importance of colors</h2>
    <p>Colors show us the world. They give us the ability to define and distinguish between things around us. Studies show that some people find <strong>solace and peace</strong> through association with a specific color(s).
      We all connect with  different colors in different ways.</p>

    <h2>Uniqueness in colors</h2>
    <p>Red, yellow, and blue are colors we know and interact with on a daily basis. However, there exist innumerable colors that we've never even heard of before. Some of them are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Glaucous: a soft shade of winter blue
        <ul>
        <li><img src="glaucous-color.jpg.webp" alt="Glaucous color" width="200" height="200" /></li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Amaranth: a red-pink hue
        <ul>
      <li><img src="https://www.colorhexa.com/e52b50.png" alt="Amaranth color" height="200" width="200" /></li></ul></li>
      <li>Celadon: a pale green color
      <ul>
        <li><img src="celadon-color.jpg.webp" alt="Celadon color" height="200" width="200" /></li>
      </ul>
    </li>
      </ul>
      <p>This just shows us how little we know about something we think we have complete knowledge of. The spectrum of colors is so vast that it is humanly <strong><em>impossible</em></strong> to name every color that exists!</p>
    <h2>The art of color mixing</h2>
    <p>Most of the unique colors that we speak about above are derived from the <strong>base colors (red, white, black, yellow, blue)</strong>. Some other colors that we see everyday are also derived from these base colors, such as:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Purple: Red+Blue</li>
      <li>Green: Blue+Yellow</li>
      <li>Orange: Red+Yellow</li>
    </ol>
    <p>There are <strong>myriad</strong> ways in which we interact with colors apart from merely seeing them everyday. Sometimes we use them in our vocabulary as metaphors; certain companies use a specific color as their identity through symbolism, and often times we use color to describe our mood.
    We may not realize it, but most of our life revolves around color. It's a beautiful blessing that we get to interact with them!</p>
